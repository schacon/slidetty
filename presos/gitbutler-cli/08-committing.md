# but commit

## Committing to any of multiple parallel or stacked branches.

Let's see a simple example of committing modified files to a branch.

Then we can try assigning stuff to a branch and just committing the assigned (staged) work.

```commands
but commit
but commit <b>
but commit --only
```
